To-Dos:
- Montecarlo
    * Add mapping and logos for teams that have been promoted this season
    * Add colors for each league (Optional)
    * Use module folder to have all the scraper functions in a separate folder.




Potential Projects:

- (BI) - This in Way back to US would be Nice | xG progression flowchart over time. Example of use case, Compare xG and xGA of Barca's Xavi vs Flick
        * Use understat links to scrape the data from https://understat.com/team/Barcelona/2024
        * Load into a dataframe and build the vizz. Refer to project from a couple years ago for base code

- (Analtyics) Relationship between Flick's style (xG increase assumption) and player valuation (Raphinha, Ferran, etc)
    * Hypothesis: since flick's style is more direct, more goals from scorers will increase their market value
